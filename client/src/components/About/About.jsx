      <p>
        At the beginning of 2020, Santa’s Elves got stranded in the North Pole.
        Elves were deeply worried all hope for the holiday season would be lost
        no thanks to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The elve’s felt a
        great responsibility to solve the challenge of delivering holiday gifts
        for all children and families affected by the global pandemic. The elves
        were hard at work, thinking how to save the spirit of happiness during
        this Christmas season. In the midst of all that passive thinking, three
        elves took action and decided, to leave the north pole to learn how to
        code, and become Full-Stack web engineers at Miami’s #1 coding school,
        Wyncode.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this idea, the elves who code realized so many people across the
        world want to help children and families this Christmas, but willing
        helpers don’t always know how and where to help. The elves coded this
        holiday helper app, to help you, the willing helper, and save the
        Christmas spirit so together, the entire community of caring kind people
        in Miami and across the world can help bring a smile to thousands of
        children this holiday season.
      </p>
      <p>You too can be a helper!</p>

        remember, there is nothing we can’t solve to make the world better, when
